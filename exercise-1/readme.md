# Depth-first searcher

A Node.js solution to the [Recurse Center's depth-first searcher pairing task](https://www.recurse.com/pairing-tasks):

> Write code that can search for a node in a tree. Return the node if it exists, and null/nil/none/undefined/false as appropriate in your language if not. For example, if the code is given `"g"` and a tree with the structure above, it should return the node named `"g"`.

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 /|\   \
d e f   g
        |
        h
```
